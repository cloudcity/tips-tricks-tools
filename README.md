# Tips, tricks, and tools

A little repo with some handy productivity saving configuration and tools that we like.

## Mac apps
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - Move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas. Makes putting windows side by side on your screen so easy! The recommended settings are great.

## Editors
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â€” A lot of the tools in this repo are for those using VSCode. If you're not, that's cool! All IDEs are welcome ðŸ¤—

Install the [shell command for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) so that you can use `code` in your shell to open a directory.

## Aliases

Delete merged branches that are not master or main
```bash
alias gclean="git branch --merged | egrep -v '(^\*|master|main)' | xargs git branch -d"
```

Delete branches squash merged into main to keep `git branch` clean (name the alias whatever you want)
```bash
alias gsqclean='git checkout -q main && git for-each-ref refs/heads/ "--format=%(refname:short)" | while read branch; do mergeBase=$(git merge-base main $branch) && [[ $(git cherry main $(git commit-tree $(git rev-parse $branch^{tree}) -p $mergeBase -m _)) == "-"* ]] && git branch -D $branch; done'
```

## Other

- [.pryrc](.pryrc) to get aliases while debugging with `pry`, e.g. `c` instead of `continue`, etc.
